This research aims to dive into the complex dynamics of global financial markets, with an
emphasis on detecting market anomalies and assessing the impact of inflation on global
indices and precious metals. The study uses a thorough predictive modelling method to
identify optimal hedging options for investment portfolios by expanding the diversification
opportunitiesto include commodities such as gold and silver. In a time where economic trends
have a significant impact on investing decisions, understanding these trends is critical for
successful portfolio management and risk mitigation. The study employs a comprehensive
analytical approach to achieve these objectives, utilising advanced data analytics techniques.
The methods include K-means and hierarchical clustering to find anomalies, whereas Support
Vector Machines and Na√Øve Bayes Classification are used to assess the impact of inflation. The
study is expected to provide valuable insightsinto the behaviour of global indices and precious
metals in response to inflation. Anomalies detected through clustering algorithms provide a
deeper understanding of market movements, while the classification models reveal the
nuanced relationship between inflation and asset prices. These findings provide useful
insights for diversification in various asset classes, emphasising the necessity of a diversified
portfolio to hedge against economic uncertainty.
